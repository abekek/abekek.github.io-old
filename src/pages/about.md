## Hi there

I am Alibek, a student at Lehigh University, an Undergraduate Researcher and currently working as an intern at Cisco in Corporate Social Responsibility Team and helping to promote and organize Cisco Networking Academyâ€™s products and events.

I have a good experience both in Software Engineering and Data Science; therefore, I have a passion for becoming an AI engineer by combining these fields. I love reading and sharing my thoughts and technical skills on my blog.

In addition, one of my favorite hobbies is karate, where I achieved the following:
* IOGKF Kazakhstan champion (ðŸ¥‡19 gold, ðŸ¥ˆ8 silver, ðŸ¥‰5 bronze medals)
* ðŸ¥‹ Okinawan Goju Ryu Karate black belt owner (1 dan)
* Bunbukan Okinawa Kobudo 4 kyu.

This website is an extended version of my [Telegram blog](https://t.me/abekek_notes) where I post mainly in Russian; however, here I will write in English. I hope you enjoy!

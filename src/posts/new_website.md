Hello! Welcome to my new website!

I'm so sad to say goodbye to the old one, but I am happy to announce that the new website is faster and most importantly has the blog feature. I will try to post English translations of popular posts from my [Telegram blog](https://t.me/abekek_notes) or/and post exclusive content here.

Enjoy and have a good time!

By the way, thanks to [@panr](https://github.com/panr) for providing this awesome template!

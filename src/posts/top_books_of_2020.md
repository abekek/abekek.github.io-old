Being stuck in quarantine, when I couldn't communicate with my surroundings the same way as I did before, the main source of these new ideas were books; they have always been, but this year they entirely changed my point of view about many aspects of my life.

This year has been pretty difficult for all of us. Sitting at home, away from our friends, our usual place of work, many of us have changed our way of life, our way of thinking.

Being stuck in quarantine, when I couldn't communicate with my surroundings the same way as I did before, the main source of these new ideas were books; they have always been, but this year they entirely changed my point of view about many aspects of my life. They changed the way I think, they brought me to places which my mind has never discovered.

Sure, not all of them were good; that is why, I decided to make a Top-5 of books that I liked the most, and that influenced my life the most this year. If you want to check out the full list of books I read this year, check [this link](/s_books).

Books are listed in no particular order.

## 1. Ego Is The Enemy - Ryan Holiday

This is the second Ryan Holiday's book I've read. I would say that I got a lot of impressions from it, and learned about myself and people even more.

The author of this book talks about what the ego is in his understanding, how it constantly interferes with us in life and how to deal with it. He constantly cites examples based on historical facts - situations faced by historical figures.

**What is ego?**

Ryan describes the ego as an unhealthy belief in self-importance, or briefly _"The Disease of ME"_. He believes that the ego is our constant enemy that harms our long-term goals and prevents us from achieving excellence in a business that really matters to us. To remind of this, he even got himself a tattoo with the inscription: "Ego is the enemy".

You can notice such a harmful influence of the ego in three stages that are constantly encountered in our life: aspiration, success and failure.

**ASPIRATION**

First, the ego wakes up when you are inspired and motivated to do something cool. Your ego begins to actively act, to seek other people's approval from the outside, asking the question: "What do other people think of me?" Thus, your ego makes you TALK about what you want to do, rather than DOing what you need to do.

We think that being active on social networks, subscribers, scrolling the feed is a real job, because noise is created, people respond, and comment on our photos; and silence and calm == inaction and failure. This is all our ego. It creates the illusion of the importance of a person who creates an image in his head that one will never reach by such paths.

Here it is important to answer the question correctly: to be or to do?

**SUCCESS**

Well, with or without ego, we have achieved success. Whether it's building a successful business or winning a sports competition, your ego will instill in you overconfidence and exaggerate your accomplishments. Instead of focusing on previous success, you will start to go overboard and look for success wherever it is not for you.

Even worse is when people, having come to success, begin to narcistically look at themselves from the outside, expecting praise. This is the ego and it pulls us down. It overestimates our achievements, and tells us about our omnipotence.

**FAILURE**

Ultimately, with or without ego, we are faced with failure. Failures happen to everyone, and that's not a bad thing - they help us learn from our mistakes. However, your ego will in every possible way justify you and relieve you of responsibility, throwing it onto others. It will sow evil on other people, and eventually bury you in a deeper hole, from which it will be even more difficult to get out.

**Ego is the enemy? But how to deal with it?**

The rule + - = (plus, minus, equal) should be applied here.

American UFC fighter Frank Shamrock said this about his students:
_They need to have someone better they can learn from, someone lesser they can teach, and someone equal they can challenge themselves against._

Thus, it is better to find someone equal to yourself to aspire (motivate each other to take action), someone better than yourself to succeed (not drowning in your glory) and someone worse than yourself to fail (helping and rising together).

This book helped me realize my mistakes. I realized that the ego often prevails in me, and honestly now I see can easliy identify people who have the same problem.

_“Ego is an evil thing. Confidence is important but ego is something false. Humility is the way to build confidence, and ego is hugely dangerous in this sport, because if you’re running on ego you aren’t running on good clean emotions or cause and effect. You bypass it to support a false idea. It’s all garbage, the ego is garbage.”_ © Frank Shamrock The Fighter’s Mind

## 2. The Book of Words - Abai Kunanbaev

I never thought that I would ever start reading Kazakh literature at my own will. However, in Spring I saw some posts in Instagram with a quote from Abai and thought: "Damn, these are really wise words," and therefore decided to read his collection of essays.

"The Book of Words" is the work of Abai (a great kazakh author who lived in 19th century), where all his wisdom is collected; it consists of his 45 mini essays. I didn't like everything, since some of the essays were already outdated, some simply spoke of the Kazakh nation, while others had too much religion (38th word), which I had not fully understood.

However, here are the words/admonitions that I recommend reading: 7, 12, 15, 17-21, 26, 32, 37, 44.

And of course, I want to share some quotes that I liked:

- "_Another temptation lurks in the path of passionate souls. Success — attained or within their grasp — intoxicates their senses and makes them dizzy. The flush of success clouds their reason and causes them to commit blunders; a man like this attracts attention even against his will, he becomes an object of gossip and a butt of ridicule. Reasonable people keep their wits about them even in such critical moments; they will not lose their senses but rather show restraint and not expose their feelings to all and sundry._"

- "_Those who have once come first and once triumphed, will not remain the fastest and strongest forever._"

- "_The source of humanity is love and justice. They are omnipresent and decide everything. They are the crown of Divine Creation. Even the way a stallion takes possession of a mare is a manifestation of love. He who is swayed by the feelings of love and justice is a wise man and a learned man._"

In general, I recommend reading it, as you can glean a lot of wisdom. How you will use this wisdom is another matter.

## 3. The Idiot - Fyodor Dostoevsky

I really liked this book, because despite the fact that it was published in the 19th century, it made me think about the moral problems of modern society. Dostoevsky wanted to portray a positively beautiful hero/ideal person. The main character is Prince Lev Nikolaevich Myshkin who with his kindness, love, and most importantly compassion, treats any person well - regardless of their social status, their character and their views on the world. Because of this, he strongly contrasts with other heroes of the book, as a result of which, he is called an "idiot"; to some extent other characters were even afraid of him.

This book shows Dostoevsky's apocalyptic vision, since he describes the death of spirituality and moral values ​​of humanity. Besides that, Dostoevsky shares his thoughts about people's striving for the originality, and how they falsely view themselves in the society. I would quote his wise words here, but then this post will become too long. Just Google for the quote starting with: "_There is nothing so annoying as to be fairly rich..._"

## 4. The Brothers Karamazov - Fyodor Dostoevsky

You may have noticed that I am a real fan of Dostoevsky's works. However, without any biased view, I can say that "The Brothers Karamazov" is the best fiction book I have ever read in my life.

This psychological crime novel brings you to the 19th century Russia, and tells you a story of morality, love, free will, and develops a philosophical conflict of faith and doubt.

From the whole book, I liked the following quote, because it reveals the entire idea of the novel, although it was not said by the most important character:

_"...we are of a broad, Karamazovian nature — and this is what I am driving at — capable of containing all possible opposites and of contemplating both abysses at once, the abyss above us, an abyss of lofty ideals, and the abyss beneath us, and abyss of the lowest and foulest degradation."_

The problem is that many people can be both mean and noble at the same time; they hesitate between moral and immoral actions and thoughts, eternally wandering in the captivity of false values, which leads to an extreme degree of moral irresponsibility. You can google the word "Karamazovshchina". It is with this word that Dostoevsky summarizes the Russian society of the 19th century, although, I think, it is applicable to the modern one.

Moral irresponsibility is the main idea of ​​the novel. In order not to spoil, I will say that it is precisely because of moral irresponsibility that something terrible happens in the novel, for which not one criminal is to blame, but the whole society. Fortunately, the main characters end up accepting this idea, but they paid very hard for not believing in it.

In general, I would recommend this book to everyone, even though it is boring and voluminous in places. It will most likely open your eyes to the problems of humanity that hinder our development.

## 5. Outliers: The Story of Success - Malcolm Gladwell

Why most NHL players are born in January? What sets Bill Gates apart from others that he became a billionaire? Why are Asian children better than American in math (that's what Gladwell says)?

These and many other questions about success are answered in Gladwell's book.

The main point of the book is to dispel the myth about "Self-made success". When we look at successful and famous people, we immediately hear stories about how they overcame difficulties, and made their way through the thorny path on their own. This is true, but not 100%.

It should always be remembered that effort is directly correlated with goal achievement, but other than that there are factors such as: timing, culture in which you grew up, how much meaning does your work make, how you manage your opportunities, and how much time you spent on reaching the goal (10,000 hours theory).

I would give examples from the book, but firstly, I don’t want to spoil the contents, since the book is quite interesting; secondly, I'm just too lazy. This pseudo review needs to be finished somehow, so here's a quote I like:

_"It is not the brightest who succeed, nor is success simply the sum of the decisions and efforts we make on our own behalf. It is, rather, a gift. Outliers are those who have been given opportunities - and who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize them."_

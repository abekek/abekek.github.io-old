The cycling race consists of several stages and the winner is determined by the sum of points for all stages. The victory in one stage does not matter if you lost in the rest, but if at some stages you arrived second, and at some fifth, then in the end you will bypass those single winners.</em></p>\n<p>That is, what I have understood, success and failure do not need to be thought of as something separate that divides people into winners and losers. On the contrary, you need to consider them as something whole, which will lead to your ultimate goal.</p>\n<p>A couple of hours ago I listened to a podcast (the link will be at the end of the post) from Harvard Business Review, where D.Wang, a professor of Northwestern University at Kellogg School of Management, spoke about this topic. And he said these words:</p>\n<p><em>Losing doesn't mean that you're out of the game.</em></p>\n<p>Thus, even if you have suffered from deep failure, this does not mean that you are no longer worth anything and have dropped out of the “game”.  You actually have a lot more advantages than most who have succeeded. You have experience - and you will no longer make the same mistake that led to failure, and this is the most important.</p>\n<p>From my father’s words, I also realized that success is an immeasurable thing. Success, as a separate unit, has no value, but failures, as I already said, can be used to get good feedback and experience.</p>\n<p><strong>A bit about my failures</strong></p>\n<p>When I was 5 years old, I just started participating in karate competitions. About the first 10 of my competitions were defeats and they were awful - I cried, was beaten, my body ached. But thanks to these defeats, I gained experience and almost every next competition I came out with a gold medal.</p>\n<p>When Cornell rejected me, I was sad, but I reviewed my strategies and eventually reached the desired goal.</p>\n<p>And this is not the end. I have achieved something, but I don’t think that I need to stop there. There are still many victories and defeats, and I am ready for them. And if I dwell on the failures, then the achieved will cease to have its meaning.</p>\n<p>I hope I helped someone, because I know that among you there are those people who may feel depressed at the moment. I advise you not to lose heart and always keep in mind the words of Wang.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cDovL2ZlZWRzLmhhcnZhcmRidXNpbmVzcy5vcmcvaGFydmFyZGJ1c2luZXNzL2lkZWFjYXN0&#x26;episode=dGFnOmF1ZGlvLmhici5vcmcsMjAwNi0wNS0wODppZGVhY2FzdC4wNzEz\">Podcast Link</a></p>\n<p><em>The post was taken and translated from the post in my <a href=\"https://t.me/abekek_notes\">Telegram blog</a> written on April 1, 2020.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"/about\">About me</a>    |    <a href=\"https://t.me/abekek_notes\">Telegram blog</a></p>","excerpt":"Once, my father told me: Life is like a cycling race.
